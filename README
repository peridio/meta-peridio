I. Adding the meta-peridio layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-peridio'

Configuring
============

Peridiod can produce fwup firmware and .img images as output from your build
by adding `fwup` and `fwup-img` to `IMAGE_FSTYPES` and adding
`IMAGE_CLASSES += image_types_fwup` to your layer (machine | distro | image)

The `fwup` and `fwup-img` `IMAGE_FSTYPES` will look for a fwup configuration
file in `(my-layer)/conf/peridio` directory with the name `${MACHINENAME}.fwup.conf`.
You can override this by setting `FWUP_FILE`. More information about fwup format
can be found at [github.com/fwup-home](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup)
