Configuring
============

Peridiod can produce fwup firmware and .img images as output from your build
by adding `fwup` and `fwup-img` to `IMAGE_FSTYPES` and adding
`IMAGE_CLASSES += image_types_fwup` to your layer (machine | distro | image)

The `fwup` and `fwup-img` `IMAGE_FSTYPES` will look for a fwup configuration
file in `(my-layer)/conf/peridio` directory with the name `${MACHINENAME}.fwup.conf`.
You can override this by setting `FWUP_FILE`. More information about fwup format
can be found at [github.com/fwup-home](https://github.com/fwup-home/fwup)

The `fwup` and `fwup-img` `do_image_` functions will need to execute after the other image
dependencies have been deployed. To handle this, you can specify what deployed image typed
you your fwup conf may depend on by appending to the `FWUP_IMAGE_DEPENDS` variable in your config.
